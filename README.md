# Privacy Policy for ContextCam

**Last updated:** December 29, 2025

ContextCam ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application collects, uses, and discloses information.

### 1. Information We Collect

**Camera and Image Data**
ContextCam requires access to your device's camera to function. The app uses the camera to scan objects in real-time and capture photos at your request.
* **Real-time scanning:** Image data is processed locally on your device or transiently sent to our AI providers to identify objects and generate fun facts.
* **Photo Capture:** Photos you take are saved only to your device's local storage or temporary memory. We do not upload your photos to any permanent external server, and we do not store a history of your images.

**Usage Data**
We do not collect personal usage data, analytics, or track your behavior across other apps and websites.

### 2. How We Use Information

We use the camera data solely to:
* Identify objects in the frame.
* Display relevant text overlays (fun facts and history).
* Create the final composite image for you to share.

### 3. Third-Party Services

We may use third-party APIs (such as generative AI services) to process the text descriptions of objects identified by the camera. These services process data transiently and are not authorized to use your data for their own training purposes.

### 4. Data Retention

We do not retain your personal data. Images processed for object recognition are discarded immediately after the analysis is complete.

### 5. Children’s Privacy

ContextCam does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.
